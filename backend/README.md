# Gen V Backend Package (`gtech-gen-v`)

This directory contains the core Python package for the main Gen V project.

The code builds the **`gtech-gen-v`** distribution package (the name used by
`pip`), which provides the **`gen_v`** import package (the name used in Python
`import` statements).

## Purpose

This package provides reusable components to support the AI-powered video ad
generation workflow.

Refer to the main project [README](../README.md) for the overall project
description, goals, and setup instructions for the Colab notebook environment.

## Structure

This package currently uses a **flat layout**:

* Package source code resides directly within the `gen_v/` directory.
* Unit tests are located in the `tests/` directory.

## Installation (for Development)

To use this package locally (e.g. for testing, contributing, or importing into
the Colab notebook), you need to install the `gtech-gen-v` distribution package.
The recommended way for development is an editable installation:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

The `-e` flag means changes you make to the source code in the `gen_v/`
directory will be reflected immediately without needing to reinstall.

## Usage

Once the `gtech-gen-v` distribution package is installed, components can be
imported into Python scripts or notebooks using the `gen_v` import name:

```python
from gen_v.models import VideoInput

video_info = VideoInput(path='/path/to/my/video.mp4')
```

## Managing Dependencies

This project uses `pip-tools` to manage dependencies and ensure reproducible
builds. Dependencies are specified in `requirements.in`, and the actual
installable dependency list (with hashes for security) is generated in
`requirements.txt`.

### Adding or Updating Dependencies

1. Edit the appropriate `.in` file:
    * `requirements.in`: For core project dependencies.
    * `requirements_dev.in`: For development-specific dependencies (e.g testing
      tools).

    Add, remove, or update package versions in the chosen file. List only the
    top-level dependencies.

    ```
    # requirements.in (Example)
    pydantic==2.11.1

    # requirements_dev.in (Example)
    pytest==8.3.5
    ```
2.  Generate the corresponding `requirements.txt` file by running the following
    commands to update the `requirements.txt` and/or `requirements_dev.txt`
    file(s) with the correct versions and hashes:

    ```bash
    pip-compile --generate-hashes --no-annotate --output-file=requirements.txt requirements.in
    pip-compile --generate-hashes --no-annotate --allow-unsafe --output-file=requirements_dev.txt requirements_dev.in
    ```

## Code Quality and Formatting

This project uses several tools to ensure code quality and consistent
formatting.

First install the dev requirements:
```bash
pip install --require-hashes -r requirements_dev.txt
```
Then you can run:

- Pylint: For static code analysis and linting. Run `pylint --recursive=y .` to
  check your code. The Pylint configuration is in `.pylintrc`.
- Pyink: For code formatting run `pyink .`. The configuration is specified in
  `pyproject.toml`

## Testing

*   Tests are located in the `tests` directory.
*   Use `pytest` to run the tests:

    ```bash
    pytest
    ```
